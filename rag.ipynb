      "==================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "üìù Question 1: Who is Hanuman and what are his special powers?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "üí¨ Answer: Based on the provided content, Hanuman is depicted as a powerful and capable figure. He displays immense strength by demolishing an Ashoka grove, uprooting trees, and destroying buildings in Lanka to demonstrate the power that would accompany Rama. Hanuman easily fights off demon guards and even kills Ravana's son, Akshay Kumar, in battle. He allows himself to be captured by Indrajit using the Brahmastra to gain an audience with Ravana, where he fearlessly delivers Rama‚Äôs message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, during his mission in Lanka, Hanuman uses his ability to alter his size, reducing himself to the size of a cat to search the city undetected. This showcases his power to change form at will, which helps him navigate through obstacles efficiently. His connection to the wind god Vayu is mentioned, indicating another aspect of his divine heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't have enough information to answer this question based on the provided content, as it does not explicitly list all of Hanuman's special powers.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "üìù Question 2: Why was Rama exiled from Ayodhya?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "üí¨ Answer: Rama was exiled from Ayodhya because his stepmother Kaikeyi, influenced by her maid Manthara, reminded King Dasharatha of two boons he had promised her years ago. She demanded that her own son Bharata be crowned king instead of Rama, and that Rama be exiled to the forest for fourteen years. King Dasharatha was bound by his promise and agreed to her demands, despite being devastated by them. Rama, upon learning of his father's predicament, accepted the exile, valuing duty and the keeping of promises over personal desires.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "üìù Question 3: How did Rama and Sita first meet?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "üí¨ Answer: Based on the provided content from the Ramayana, Rama and Sita first met during the swayamvara ceremony held in the kingdom of Mithila. Rama had accompanied the sage Vishwamitra to Mithila, where a condition for marrying Princess Sita was set: the suitor had to string and break the mighty bow of Lord Shiva. Rama, unlike other princes and kings, was able to lift the bow with ease, string it, and draw it so powerfully that it broke into two pieces. Sita, observing these events from behind a curtain, was overwhelmed by Rama's strength and noble demeanor. She chose him as her husband by placing the wedding garland around his neck.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "üìù Question 4: What happened during the battle between Rama and Ravana?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "üí¨ Answer: During the battle between Rama and Ravana, both warriors demonstrated incredible skills and utilized divine weapons. Ravana, despite having ten heads and twenty arms, and his knowledge of divine weapons obtained through years of penance, was unable to defeat Rama. The turning point came when Rama invoked the Brahmastra, a powerful divine weapon given to him by the sage Agastya. This weapon pierced Ravana's heart, leading to his death. In his final moments, Ravana realized Rama's divine nature and found peace.\n",
